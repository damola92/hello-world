# hello-world
What is this even?
I am a Illustration and Graphic Designer graduate who lost interest in doing that a long time ago, I know wish to learn how to code/programme and hopefully create a career in this.
Starting of with HTML5/CSS as to get some work graphic/web designing then moving on to Javascript.
